# Weather-Based Photography Alert

This Python project combines weather data with camera settings recommendations to help photographers capture the perfect shot.

## Features

* **Weather Alerts:** Fetches real-time weather information and sends email alerts when conditions are ideal for photography.
* **Camera Settings Suggestions:** Provides recommended camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) based on the current weather conditions.
* **Customizable Preferences:** Allows users to set their preferred photography conditions and notification preferences. 
* **Potential for Camera Integration:** Includes conceptual code to demonstrate how to integrate with a camera API to apply suggested settings automatically.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.x
   * `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
   * `yagmail` library (`pip install yagmail`)
   * (Optional) Camera API library specific to your camera model

2. **Configuration:**
   * Replace placeholders in the code:
     * `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
     * `"your_email@gmail.com"` and `"your_email_password"`: Your Gmail credentials (or adjust for your email provider).
   * If integrating with a camera, install the necessary library and configure the connection details.

3. **Run the script:**
   * Execute the Python script from your terminal.
   * Enter your desired city when prompted.
   * If the weather is ideal for photography, you'll receive an email alert with suggested camera settings.

## Future Enhancements

* **More Sophisticated Weather Analysis**: Incorporate additional weather parameters and historical data for refined predictions.
* **User Interface**: Build a web or mobile app for a more user-friendly experience.
* **Expanded Camera Integration**: Implement full integration with camera APIs to automatically adjust settings.
* **Machine Learning**: Explore using ML models to predict optimal photography conditions.
