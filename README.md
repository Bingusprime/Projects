Camera Setting Suggestions: Provides tailored camera settings (ISO, Aperture, Shutter Speed, White Balance, and additional tips) based on the weather conditions.
Email Notifications: Sends an email containing the weather information and camera setting suggestions to a specified recipient.
Environment Variable Integration: Securely stores sensitive information like API keys and email credentials in environment variables.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to gracefully manage API request failures and email sending issues.
Prerequisites:
